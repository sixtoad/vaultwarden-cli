# vaultwarden-cli

A pure Rust command-line client for [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) (Bitwarden-compatible server). Retrieve secrets from your vault for use in shell scripts, environment variables, and automation workflows.

## Why Rust?

This project is intentionally built in pure Rust rather than Node.js. Command-line tools should be fast, self-contained, and have minimal dependencies. Node.js CLI tools require a runtime, have slow startup times, and bring along thousands of transitive dependencies. Rust compiles to a single static binary that starts instantly and has zero runtime dependencies.

Additionally, this uses the system certificate store for TLS verification, not a bundled certificate store like Node.js. This means it respects your system's CA certificates and corporate proxy configurations out of the box.

## Features

- OAuth2 client credentials authentication
- PBKDF2 key derivation (configurable iterations)
- AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 decryption (Bitwarden-compatible)
- RSA-OAEP decryption for organization vault items
- Persistent sessions with secure credential storage
- Multiple output formats: JSON, environment exports, raw values
- Search and filter vault items
- Run commands with secrets injected as environment variables
- Interpolate secrets into YAML files

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest prebuilt binary for your OS/arch from:

```
https://github.com/haydonryan/vaultwarden-cli/releases
```

Extract the archive and place `vaultwarden-cli` somewhere on your `PATH`.

### From Source

Requires Rust 1.88+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haydonryan/vaultwarden-cli.git
cd vaultwarden-cli
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/vaultwarden-cli`.

### From the Arch User Repository (AUR)

On Arch Linux you can install a prebuilt binary from the AUR, or build from source:

```bash
# Prebuilt binary
yay -S vaultwarden-cli-bin
# or: paru -S vaultwarden-cli-bin

# Build from source
yay -S vaultwarden-cli
```

Both packages install `vaultwarden-cli` to `/usr/bin`. The PKGBUILDs live in
`packaging/aur/` in this repository.

### With Nix

This repository is a Nix flake exposing two packages (plus a `nix develop`
shell with the Rust toolchain and native build deps):

- `.#app-bin` — installs the prebuilt release artifact (fast, no compilation).
  This is also the `default` package.
- `.#app-src` — builds `vaultwarden-cli` from source via the committed
  `Cargo.lock` (no network at build time).

```bash
# Run the prebuilt binary (fast path)
nix run .#app-bin -- --version

# Run a from-source build
nix run .#app-src -- --version

# Build either into ./result
nix build .#app-bin
nix build .#app-src
```

Both packages install the same `vaultwarden-cli` executable. To add it to your
profile: `nix profile install .#app-bin`. The flake supports `x86_64-linux` and
`aarch64-linux`.

## Development

Enable the repo's pre-commit hook to run `just pre-commit` before each commit:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

You can run the same suite manually with:

```bash
just pre-commit
```

Run coverage with tarpaulin using an isolated `/tmp` run root so build artifacts
and the JSON report stay out of the checkout:

```bash
just coverage
```

The recipe prints the run root and leaves `tarpaulin-report.json` in that
temporary output directory for inspection. Remove the printed run root when you
no longer need the report.

## Usage

### Authentication

First, create an API key in your Vaultwarden/Bitwarden web vault under Settings > Security > Keys > API Key.

```bash
# Login with your API credentials
vaultwarden-cli login \
  --server https://your-vaultwarden-server.com \
  --client-id "user.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  --client-secret "your-client-secret"

# Or use environment variables for client credentials
export VAULTWARDEN_CLIENT_ID="user.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
export VAULTWARDEN_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
vaultwarden-cli login --server https://your-vaultwarden-server.com

# Unlock the vault with your master password
vaultwarden-cli unlock
```

Note: `unlock` validates (and refreshes if needed) your API token before prompting.
If the token is expired and cannot be refreshed, you will need to run `vaultwarden-cli login` again.

### Retrieving Secrets

```bash
# List all items (plain output: env var names)
vaultwarden-cli list
# Output:
# GITHUB_URI
# GITHUB_USERNAME
#
# MY_NOTE

# List only login items
vaultwarden-cli list --type login

# Search for items
vaultwarden-cli list --search github

# Output full item payloads as JSON
vaultwarden-cli list --json

# Get a specific item (by name or ID)
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login"

# Get item as environment variable exports
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --format env
# Output:
# export MY_LOGIN_URI="https://example.com"
# export MY_LOGIN_USERNAME="user@example.com"
# export MY_LOGIN_PASSWORD="secret123"

# Get just the password (useful for piping)
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --format value
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --password   # shorthand
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" -p           # short flag

# Get just the username
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --format username
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --username   # shorthand
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" -u           # short flag

# Get item by URI instead of name
vaultwarden-cli get-uri github.com
vaultwarden-cli get-uri github.com -p       # just password
vaultwarden-cli get-uri github.com -u       # just username
```

### Using in Scripts

```bash
# Source credentials into environment
eval $(vaultwarden-cli get "AWS Production" --format env)
aws s3 ls

# Pass password to another command
vaultwarden-cli get "Database" --format value | psql -U admin -W

# Use in a script
#!/bin/bash
DB_PASS=$(vaultwarden-cli get "Database" --format value)
mysql -u root -p"$DB_PASS" -e "SELECT 1"
```

### Running Commands with Secrets

Run commands with secrets injected as environment variables. The secrets are only available to the spawned process and do not persist in your shell.

```bash
# Run a command with secrets from an item injected as env vars
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" -- printenv MY_LOGIN_USERNAME MY_LOGIN_PASSWORD

# `--name` is optional when you want to match by item name
vaultwarden-cli run "My Login" -- printenv MY_LOGIN_USERNAME MY_LOGIN_PASSWORD

# Run a command with multiple items (comma-separated)
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login, API Token" -- ./deploy.sh

# Run a bash script directly
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" -- bash ./scripts/rotate-keys.sh

# If you need shell expansion or positional parameters, invoke a shell explicitly
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" -- bash -lc 'docker compose up "$1"' -- "$1"

# Filter by organisation and/or folder instead of (or in addition to) a name
vaultwarden-cli run --org "Acme Corp" --folder "Production" -- ./deploy.sh

# Run with URI matching instead of name
vaultwarden-cli run-uri github.com -- git push

# Preview which environment variables would be injected (without values)
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" --info
vaultwarden-cli run-uri github.com --info
```

Environment variables are named `{ITEM_NAME}_{FIELD}` where:
- `{ITEM_NAME}` is the item name converted to uppercase with non-alphanumeric chars replaced by underscores
- `{FIELD}` is one of: `URI`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, or custom field names

`vaultwarden-cli run` executes the command directly. Shell features like `$1`, globbing, pipes,
and variable expansion only work if you explicitly run a shell such as `bash -lc '...'`.

### Interpolating YAML

Replace placeholders like `((s3.username))` in a YAML file with Vaultwarden secrets and write to stdout.

```bash
# Replace placeholders and write to a new file
vaultwarden-cli interpolate --file config.yml > config.rendered.yml

# Safely write to a file, including replacing the input file
vaultwarden-cli interpolate --file config.yml --output config.yml

# Leave missing placeholders untouched instead of failing
vaultwarden-cli interpolate --file config.yml --skip-missing
```

Placeholders use the format `((name.component))` where:
- `name` matches a Vaultwarden item name (case-insensitive)
- `component` is `username`, `password`, `uri`, or a custom field name such as `token`

### Session Management

```bash
# Check current status
vaultwarden-cli status

# Lock the vault (clears decryption keys)
vaultwarden-cli lock

# Logout completely (clears all saved data)
vaultwarden-cli logout
```

## Output Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `json` | Full item details as JSON (default) |
| `env` | Shell export commands for URI, USERNAME, PASSWORD, and custom fields |
| `value` | Just the password, no newline |
| `username` | Just the username, no newline |

JSON output includes decrypted secret fields such as passwords, notes, custom fields, and SSH keys.
When stdout is redirected or captured, JSON output is blocked unless you pass
`--allow-plaintext-json` or set `VAULTWARDEN_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_JSON=true`.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in:
- Linux: `~/.config/vaultwarden-cli/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.vaultwarden.vaultwarden-cli/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\vaultwarden\vaultwarden-cli\`

Client secrets are stored securely using the system keyring (libsecret on Linux, Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows).

### Linux: D-Bus Secret Service (keyring)

On Linux, secure client-secret storage requires:
- A user D-Bus session
- A Secret Service provider (for example `gnome-keyring`)

If you see an error like `org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown` for `org.freedesktop.secrets`, install keyring support:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S dbus libsecret gnome-keyring

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dbus-user-session libsecret-1-0 gnome-keyring

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo dnf install -y dbus-daemon libsecret gnome-keyring
```

Verify the service is available in your user session:

```bash
busctl --user list | grep org.freedesktop.secrets
```

If you run in a headless/minimal environment without Secret Service, `vaultwarden-cli` still works, but you may need to pass `--client-secret` on login.

## Security

- Master password is never stored.
- Client secrets and unlocked vault keys are stored in the system keyring when available.
- If the keyring is unavailable, unlocked vault keys are not persisted by default; unlock state is memory-only for that process.
- The legacy plaintext `keys.json` fallback is disabled by default. Set `VAULTWARDEN_ALLOW_INSECURE_KEY_FILE=true` only when you intentionally accept owner-only but unencrypted key storage for an isolated compatibility/test environment.
- Decryption keys can be cleared at any time with `lock`
- All cryptographic operations use well-audited Rust crates

## Building

Requirements:
- Rust 1.70+
- On Linux: `libdbus-1-dev` and `libsecret-1-dev` for keyring support

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Tested On

- Arch Linux

### Ordinary test prerequisites (Linux)

Ordinary `cargo test` runs server-independent private-keyring isolation tests,
even when live-server variables are unset. Install `dbus-daemon`,
`gnome-keyring-daemon`, `gdbus`, and `secret-tool` first. On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dbus-daemon gnome-keyring libglib2.0-bin libsecret-tools
./scripts/with-secure-test-tmpdir.sh cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
```

These tests start disposable private services; they do not need a desktop session
or Docker. Their process-ownership checks require Linux pidfds (kernel 5.3+).

### Disposable live regression suite (Linux)

Run `./scripts/test-live.sh` to provision Vaultwarden **1.36.0** on an ephemeral
loopback port, execute the live tests, and remove that run's Compose project.
An accessible local Docker default engine at `/var/run/docker.sock` and either a
system-installed `docker compose` plugin or standalone `docker-compose` on the
runner's PATH (`~/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`) are required, along with
`dbus-daemon`, `gnome-keyring-daemon`, `gdbus`, and `secret-tool`.
The live runner also requires `curl` and GNU `timeout` (from coreutils).
The secure temporary-directory wrapper requires safe, non-writable directory
ancestry under your home; do not relax shared-directory permissions to run it.
Nondefault Docker contexts, remote/rootless engines, and user-local Compose
plugins are unsupported. The runner rejects a selected nondefault engine/context
before clearing the environment, then explicitly selects the local socket. It
uses private HOME/Docker configuration, so user plugin settings, registry logins,
and context configuration are not inherited.

The runner clears inherited environment variables. Each fixture starts its own
private D-Bus and synthetic unlocked keyring, proves that it can save and read a
sentinel before provisioning, and gives CLI children private HOME/XDG paths.
It never requires your desktop vault or credentials. Successful unlock is
verified through a subsequent command using the private keyring; plaintext key
fallback is not enabled. A server-independent sentinel/fake-desktop-bus test
runs before the disposable server starts.

Optional arguments filter the test harness, for example
`./scripts/test-live.sh session::`. Only an unfiltered invocation verifies the
complete live suite. Ordinary `cargo test` without both live configuration
variables reports live cases as successful early returns; those are not live
executions. See [repair verification](docs/implementation/live-test-repair-verification.md)
for execution accounting and cleanup limits.
